# mobileslider

Decided to try a slider without arrows and click events.
I used Traversy Media's tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bxFSOA5JYo for the first one. Thanks!
Then reverse engineered the code and built the second one myself.
I used pictures of Digimon because Digimon are cool.
This technique, with different pictures, will be incorporated in my React gallery app soon.
